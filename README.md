# Chrome Download Panel

Adds a download panel to your devtools!

Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/download-panel/dfkcgjijchipieeogdonnjbhlhjphbfn

When this extension fails to do the job, you can try [Chrono Download Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrono-download-manager/mciiogijehkdemklbdcbfkefimifhecn). Then file an issue and let me know how I can improve this extension. :)

# Tips
- If you have an url copied when opening the download panel, it will be pasted to the url field automatically.
- End filename with `/` to automatically append filename from url.
- The extension from the URL is automatically used if you don't specify an extension in the filename field.
- Middle-click the `[download]` link to open a save-as dialog.
- Middle-click the url to open it in a new tab.
- Inspect an element and a badge will appear in the filename text field. Click it to use the text contents as your filename.
- A red circle means that the network entry appeared after you filtered the list. A green circle means you have already downloaded the URL (it is in the history list).
