# Chrome Download Panel ![](download-panel/img/icon32.png)

Adds a download panel to your devtools!

When this extension fails to do the job, you can try [Chrono Download Manager](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrono-download-manager/mciiogijehkdemklbdcbfkefimifhecn). Then file an issue and let me know how I can improve this extension. :)
